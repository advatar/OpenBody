## Latest bounded patch

Commit `253b65536050f7f6d65916355f55aaca175775a4` closes the final P1 reported by the local bounded review of `6f422f9d46f1323627dc7340f6370ed5ea9497b8`:

1. Every model cited by an evidence object must individually support every scope on that object at the exact placement; unrelated producers cannot pass through unioned scope coverage.
2. Disjoint per-model attribution in OpenBody 0.1 is represented by separate scoped evidence references, while a single correctly scoped producer remains valid.

The patch tightens the shared placement-aware evidence/producer scope maps rather than adding fixture-specific exceptions. It preserves the previously closed subject, scope, temporal, discoverability, capability/applicability, evidence, request-response, outcome/calibration, and authority invariants.

## Qualification results

- Reference suite: `56 passed`
- Conformance validator: all examples pass
- JSON Schema validation/parsing: pass
- OpenAPI parsing: pass
- MCP profile parsing: pass
- `git diff --check`: pass
- GitHub `validate` CI: pass

## Active gate

A single final bounded adversarial Codex review must now verify qualified protocol commit `253b65536050f7f6d65916355f55aaca175775a4`.

Acceptance criterion: **0 unresolved in-scope P1/P2 findings** across the established OpenBody 0.1 invariant classes. The review must not expand into performance, deployment hardening, future protocol features, or unrelated security concerns.

Do not merge PR #5 or resolve historical review threads until this gate is clean. If the review reports another in-scope P1/P2, treat only that finding as the next blocker and do not widen the patch opportunistically.

If the review returns zero unresolved in-scope P1/P2 findings:

1. Resolve the historical review threads.
2. Merge PR #5.
3. Freeze and tag the OpenBody 0.1 interoperability baseline.
4. Rebase InVivo/Metabolog #972 onto that exact contract.
5. Add cross-repository conformance fixtures and CI.

## Local workspace hygiene

The LandingPage repository is pushed on its `main` branch at `cd361000533d07f28d99456ec51c77fd4140adeb`. OpenBody records it as a submodule in commit `b2b937c847e5892fce5890a0280c3a51f50bdfdb`. The model manifesto and its deliverable assets are committed at `5e174482321f96fb83bcf332312c0f300aa4eb17`.

The local working tree was clean when this handover was updated.
